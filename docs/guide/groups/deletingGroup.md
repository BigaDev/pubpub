# Deleting a Group

## (FEATURE COMING SOON)

Deleting a group is possible. It should be understood though, that because PubPub is a publishing platform - the metadata associated with published documents is public and archived. Deleting a group will not delete published pubs or comments associated with the group - these are archived and permanent. 

To delete an group navigate to the group profile. Click the `Settings` button and scroll to the bottom of the page. Click the 'Delete Group' button and complete the verification.
